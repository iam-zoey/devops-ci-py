# Github Actions CI Template 

The template is designed to work with GitHub Actions and can be customized for various projects. It includes configurations for building, testing, and deploying applications with a focus on security and best practices.

Please note that SonarQube integration and JFrog Artifactory (for pulling dependencies and pushing images) are not yet implemented.


## Prerequisites
Before using this template, ensure you have the following:

- Snyk Token : For vulnerability scanning (if configured).
- Docker Account: For pushing the images 


### 
`.github/workflows` is a directory for YAML files that define GitHub Actions workflows. 
This template has key five stages:
- Get the source code
- 
- 
-
- 

Once pushed, GitHub Actions will automatically run the workflow according to the triggers specified. You can view the results and logs in the "Actions" tab of your repository on GitHub.
